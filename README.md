Welcome to my canvas game, Preservation Panic!
You are the hero in the center of the screen, Archie R. Kive.  Your goal is to collect all the Dr Who tape reels from around the BBC tape library.  Move with the arrow keys.

I created new images for all elements, changed the canvas size, then tweaked movement and spawn locations to account for new size.  I also made respawns only account for a new reel, created a win condition, and created a switch to display the factoid tiles.  Also did simple work on the html page to link to video and transcript.

Forked from the wonderful folks at Lost Decade Games.  Original build by Matt Hackett.

Watch me play on youtube - 
Or read the transcript for the tiles -
